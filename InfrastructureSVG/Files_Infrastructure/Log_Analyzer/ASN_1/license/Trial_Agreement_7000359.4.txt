alter these rights and no title to or ownership of the Proprietary 
Information or any intellectual property rights with respect thereto 
are transferred to Customer.  No rights are granted to Customer other

LICENSE FEES.

    3.2 Maintaining Confidentiality.  Customer acknowledges and agrees 
that the Proprietary Information is the confidential information of 
OSS.  Customer will maintain the confidentiality of the Proprietary 
Information using at least the same procedures as it uses to maintain

in no event shall Customer use less than reasonable care.  Customer 
shall not remove any copyright, confidentiality, or other proprietary
rights notice provided by OSS in connection with any Proprietary 
Information and any and all copies which Customer may make shall have
such notices.  In addition, Customer agrees, that unless expressly

immediately terminate this Agreement and the license to use the 
Programs by providing written notice to any email address provided by
Customer to OSS.

    4.2 Effect of Termination.  Without limiting any other rights and 
remedies, upon the termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted 
to Customer hereunder shall immediately terminate upon the termination
or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, unless Customer has 
entered into another license agreement with OSS with respect to the 
Programs that allows Customer to continue to use the Programs (in 
which case termination of such licenses covered by such license 
agreement shall be governed by such license agreement).  Except if 
Customer enters into another license agreement with OSS with respect 
to the Programs, upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, 
Customer will immediately cease using the Programs and the Generated 
Source, erase or otherwise destroy all copies of the Proprietary 
Information, and delete all components of the Proprietary Information 
from its systems and will provide certification to OSS by an authorized 
officer of the Customer.  Sections 1, 3, 4.2, 4.3, 5 and 6 shall 
survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and the other 
provisions of this Agreement shall terminate upon the termination or

matter.  This Agreement may only be amended by a document that expressly 
states that it is an amendment to this Agreement and that is executed by
both of the parties, which amendment expressly references the sections
in this Agreement that it is amending. The failure of either party at 
any time to enforce any right or remedy available to it under this 
Agreement or otherwise with respect to any breach or failure by the 
other party will not be construed to be a waiver of such right or remedy
with respect to such breach or failure of any other breach or failure by
the other party.  Any waiver of the performance of any of the terms or 
conditions of this Agreement shall be effective only if in writing and 
signed by the party against which such waiver is to be enforced. 

    6.2 Certain Remedies. Customer will pay reasonable expenses, 
including legal fees, incurred by OSS to enforce its rights under this 
Agreement.   In the event of (i) any breach or threatened breach of any
provision of this Agreement by Customer with respect to or relating to 
any of the Proprietary Information or (ii) any infringement or 
threatened infringement by Customer of any of OSS' intellectual property
rights, OSS may incur irreparable injury inadequately compensated by 
money damages and OSS may seek an injunction (including, without 
limitation, temporary and preliminary relief) and other appropriate 
equitable remedies with respect thereto without posting a bond.  This 
remedy is in addition to such other remedies as OSS may have under this
Agreement or by law.

    6.3 Law and Venue. This Agreement and all transactions under it and 
all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the 
Proprietary Information, including, without limitation, tort claims, 
will be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey excluding its 
choice of laws, rules, except that with respect to any claim with 
respect to copyright and patent rights United States federal laws shall
apply.  The parties agree that the United Nations Convention for the 
International Sale of Goods shall not apply or govern this Agreement.  
With respect to all disputes and claims arising out of relating to this
Agreement, or any of the Proprietary Information, the parties agree to 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Jersey federal and state
courts and waive any claim of or any rights with respect to immunity or 
inconvenient form.

Party (as hereinafter defined), (ii) it will only export or re-export the
Proprietary Information and the Products in compliance with the laws of the
United States, including without limitation all Export Administration

sole responsibility for any violation of such laws and regulations. In
addition, Customer certifies it will not provide or license any of the
Proprietary Information or the Products to entities or persons or for uses
prohibited by United States export laws or regulations. Customer also
certifies that no officer, director or employee of Customer who is a
Restricted Party has or will (a) participate in the negotiation, drafting or

immediately inform OSS of such status and (ii) this Agreement and the license
granted hereunder shall immediately terminate and OSS shall not be obligated
to return any paid license fees.

email provided by Customer to OSS.

    6.6 Partial Invalidity. If any of the provisions of this Agreement 
will be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability

obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.

    6.7 Assignment.  Customer has no right to assign or transfer this 
Agreement or the license granted under this Agreement, including,
